# SpaceInvaders

Project done in 2020, with this I improved my OOP skills and learned the basics of graphical interface in Java.

I didn't do any modifications on the project. It is still the same as I submitted it for grading.

To play the game, download the files and open them as a project in a Java IDE. Then you can execute it and play the game.
